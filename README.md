###[what is osm](http://maptime.io/osm-101/#0)  
"Wikipedia of maps"

So, a global dataset of anything people map  

And it's yours (and everyone's)  

More than just basemaps, a huge source of data  


###why is this exciting?
You can use it to power your apps and do cool data analysis  

Like an app that tells you the [prices of a cup of coffee in your city](http://www.macwright.org/coffeedex/index.html#/)  
  
  

To start using OSM data, we need to know  

1. **What's in the dataset**  

2. **How to access it**  

###OSM data  
######what's inside OSM?  
[The Elements](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Elements) of OSM data:  


* [Nodes](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Elements#Node)  
* [Ways](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Way)  
* [Relationships](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation)



Each node, way, or relation has information stored about it.  

All information is stored as tags of Key-Value pairs.


A cafe would look like this:

It's helpful to [look at standards](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tags) for tagging OSM features.  


###using osm data  

There are two ways we can work with OSM data:  
  
  1.Download a data file and work with it locally (PostGIS or QGIS)  
  2.Directly query the OSM dataset with the Overpass API  
  
####Downloading data  
  
**Common sources:**  
[Planet.osm](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm)- a 575 gb file of the global dataset  
[Continent](http://download.geofabrik.de)  
[Metro-Area](https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts)  
  
**Available formats:**  
XML (native) 
PBF (xml binary-smaller and faster) 
GeoJSON  
Shapefile

###osm data tools  


###example

We'll use OSM data to tell us where we could grab drinks.    

We need to know:   

1.**Where we are**  
2.**Where the bars are**  
  
  We'll use the Overpass API since we don't need the entire city's data.  We're just asking for a couple of nodes nearby.  
    
    [Overpass API](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API)
<!--- "The Overpass API (or OSM3S) is a read-only API that serves up custom selected parts of the OSM map data. It acts as a database over the web: the client sends a query to the API and gets back the data set that corresponds to the query." -->
Allows you to request specific data (with a query).  
Has it's own [query language](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Language_Guide).    
Can be used as a backend for live-osm applications.  

**Get our location**  

  143 Roebling Street, #2, Brooklyn, NY  
  

**Get bar locations:**  


Since the Overpass Query Language can be confusing, let's use a tool that helps us build our query.  
[Overpass Turbo](http://overpass-turbo.eu/)

overpass api  
<pre><code>wget -O osm_pubs.osm "http://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter?data=[out:json][timeout:25];(node["amenity"="pub"](40.70995118412107,-73.9604287147522,40.718236246820766,-73.9545578956604););out body;>;out skel qt;"
</code></pre>
